"The script DPW_Science_and_Monitoring.py uses this script to control which fields to calculate and how to calculate them.  It will ignore the first two rows, and will ignore Columns B, D, F (which are used for human readability).  This CSV can pass the field name to use as the select field, the field name to calculate, and the calculation itself.  NOTE that [DateOfSurvey] field is too complicated to pass a calculation via this CSV.  That calculation is performed in the script itself.",,,,,
