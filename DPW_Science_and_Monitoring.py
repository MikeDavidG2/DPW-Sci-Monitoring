# Name:        DPW_Science_and_Monitoring.py
# Purpose:
"""
This script is intended to be used in conjunction with DPW's Science and
Monitoring Survey123 Field Survey and the SITES database on AGOL.
The Survey is used to gather data in the
field by monitors.  The Survey sends the data to an AGOL database where it waits
to be grabbed by this script.  The SITES database is used by Collector so the
monitors can see where their sites are located.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS:
To download data stored on AGOL servers that were added via Survey123 by DPW's
  Science and Monitoring Project.
To process the downloaded data and append the downloaded data to a FGDB that
  contains the most up-to-date data.
To download JPEG's taken in the field and name them based on the site ID and the
  Sample Event ID

DETAILED PROCESS:
1. Import Modules
2. Define main() function.
  2.1 Set variables used in the script.
  2.2 Call functions
    2.2.1  Get the current date and time
    2.2.2  Create a log file and turn the print statement to a logging object.
    2.2.3  Get the last time the data was retrieved from AGOL
    2.2.4  Get the token to gain access to the AGOL database.
    2.2.5  Get the most recent DPW_WP_FIELD_DATA from AGOL and store in a
             working FGDB.  This data is from Survey123.
    2.2.6  Removed function (used to be to get the Attachments on the BLUE net
             but now there is a seperate script that does this named:
             Download_Sci_and_Mon_Attachments.py that is on the County Network at:
             \\cosd.co.san-diego.ca.us\sandfsroot\lueg\DPW\Watershed Project\Database\Script\Download_Sci_and_Mon_Attachments.py
    Pause DPW_WP_FIELD_DATA processing

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Start DPW_WP_SITES processing
    2.2.7  Get all of the the DPW_WP_SITES from AGOL and store in the same
             working folder as above.  This data is from Collector.
    2.2.8  QA/QC the DPW_WP_SITES data.
    2.2.9  If no QA/QC errors in DPW_WP_SITES, calculate X and Y fields.
    2.2.10 See if any sites are marked for deletion if so, delete them in
             downloaded SITES data and then in AGOL database.
             Send an email letting DPW know a site has been deleted.
    2.2.11 If no QA/QC errors in DPW_WP_SITES, Delete the features in
             DPW_WP_SITES in the prod FGDB and append the features just downloaded
             and QA/QC'd.
    Finish DPW_WP_SITES processing

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Resume DPW_WP_FIELD_DATA processing
    2.2.12 Copy the original DPW_WP_FIELD_DATA to a working FC.
    2.2.13 Add fields to the working FC.
    2.2.14 Calculate fields in the working FC.
    2.2.15 Delete fields from the working FC.
    2.2.16 Export working FC to TABLE.
    2.2.17 Get non-default field mappings so we can append fields from the TABLE
             to the production database if the field names are not the same
             between the working database and the production database.
    2.2.18 Set the last time the data was retrieved from AGOL to the start_time
             of this script so the next time it is run it will only grab
             new data.
    2.2.19 Append the working DPW_WP_FIELD_DATA to the production database.
    2.2.20 Search for and handle any Duplicates.
    2.2.21 Email results.
  2.3 Print out information about the script

NOTE:  This is a long and complex script.  Navigation between the main function
(which drives the script) and the secondary functions (which drive specific
tasks) will be easier with an IDE such as PyScripter as opposed to the generic
IDLE.

    PARAMETERS:
      wkg_sites_data (str): Full path to the downloaded SITES data in a wkg FGDB.
      required_fields (str): List of strings that contains the field names of
        fields that must have a value.  'NULL' and blanks ('') count as not
        having a value.
      prod_sites_data (str): Full path to the production SITES data in a prod
        FGDB.
      email_list (str): List of strings that contains the email addresses of
        anyone who should receive emails if there are 'error' or 'info' emails.
      stage (str): The stage (DEV, BETA, PROD) that this script is running in.
        Used in the email subject line.
      SITES_Edit_WebMap (str): The URL to the Edit map for that stage. This is
        used in the error/info emails so that the DPW users can go directly to
        the web map.

    RETURNS:
      valid_data (Boolean): Returned as 'True' unless there is any one of the
        possible errors checked for below--then it is returned as 'False'.  This
        boolean can be used in the main function to control if the SITES data
        is copied from the wkg database to the prod database.

    FUNCTION:
      To QA/QC for a variety of possible errors in the SITES data from AGOL.
      If there are errors, the returned 'valid_data' boolean value can be used
      to prevent data with errors from overwriting good production data.  An
      email will be sent for each check that results in an error.  If any errors
      exist 'valid_data' will be turned to 'False'.

      The process for this function is as follows:
        1. Check for duplicate Station IDs in the working Sites data
             --Send an email if error
        2. Check for any NULL values in required fields
             --Send an email if error
        3. Check for any NULL values in StationID
             --Send an email if error
        4. Check for any StationID's in the production database that are not
           in the working data
             --Send an email if error
        5. Report any StationID's that are in wkg data but not prod
           (These are probably newly added sites, and not errors)
             --Send an email if any new site in AGOL (not an error email)

    NOTE: This function assumes that the function 'Email_W_Body()' is accessible.

      B) Sort the duplicates into one of two duplicate categories:
            a. Type 1 or Type 2
            b. Type 3
            * Types explained below
      C) Handle the Type 1 or Type 2 duplicates by deleting all of the
           duplicates except for the youngest duplicate (per duplication).
           This means that only the youngest duplicate remains in the dataset.
           (Google 'Last one to sync wins'.  This is a common method for
           handling conflicting data.)
      D) Handle the Type 3 duplicates by renaming the SampleEventID for all
           Type 3 duplicates so that it is obvious that there was a duplicate.
           Make a list of Type 3 duplicates so that they can be mentioned in
           an email

    *TYPES OF DUPLICATES:
      Type 1:  Can occur if a survey is sent late enough in the day that the
          survey arrives to the online database the next day (UTC time).  This
          means the data is retrieved by script the next morning when it is run,
          AND is grabbed again the following day because the script is looking
          for all data that arrived to the database the previous day.  These
          duplicates are IDENTICAL.

          Can be FIXED by deleting either duplication.  We will delete the older.

      Type 2:  Occurs when users go into their 'Sent' folder on their device and
          opens up an already sent survey and resends the survey.  It may be an
          accident, or on purpose.  The survey may be DIFFERENT or IDENTICAL to
          the original, and there may be more than 2 of this type of duplicate.

          Can be FIXED by deleting all of these duplicates, except for the last
          submitted survey.  This is the 'youngest' survey and will act as the
          only true version.  This will allow the users to make corrections in
          the field.

      Type 3:  Occurs when two users start a survey within 1/10th of a second
          of each other on the same day.  Very rare (about once per decade if
          there are 3 monitors submitting 30 records M-F over 6 hours each day).
          These surveys will be completely DIFFERENT with the exception of the
          Sample Event ID.

          Can be FIXED by giving these duplicates a new SampleEventID that can
          still be easily converted back to the original SampleEventID.
          For example, appending an incrementing number to the end of the ID
          so that two duplicates of:
            '20170502.123456'
          becomes:
            '20170502.1234561'
          and:
            '20170502.1234562'
          This script will change the SampleEventIDs as described above

          NOTE: IF a Type 3 duplicate happens and then a monitor resends their
          survey (creaing a Type 2 duplicate), the SampleEventID will have
          Both a Type 3 and a Type 2 duplicate associated with it.  In this event
          The script will file this duplicate as a Type 3 and will rename all
          of the duplicates.
          It will not delete the Type 2 duplicate as might be expected.

          NOTE: If a Type 1 or 2 duplicate has an associated attachment, this
          script will not delete the attachment.  The attachments will be given
          the same names 'PEN-001_20170505.123456' and will append the next
          letter in the alphabet up to '_G'.  This will make it look like a
          different photo was downloaded, but this photo is a duplicate.
          This is a known limitation to the current function.
